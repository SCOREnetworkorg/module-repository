    "text": "Introduction\nIn this engaging activity, we explore the exciting sport of NCAA Division I Lacrosse, with a special focus on faceoff percentages—a critical aspect of the game. A faceoff occurs at the start of each quarter and after every goal, where two players compete to gain possession of the ball, setting the stage for their team’s offensive play. Winning a high percentage of faceoffs is often key to controlling the game and can significantly impact a team’s overall performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo Demonstrating a Faceoff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur primary goal is to compare a specific team’s faceoff performance with overall league statistics for the 2022-2023 season. Through this exploration, we’ll introduce you to the concept of one-sample proportion hypothesis testing, a powerful statistical tool widely used in sports analytics. By the end of this exercise, you’ll gain a fundamental understanding of hypothesis testing and how it can be practically applied to evaluate team performance in lacrosse and beyond.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity Length\n\n\n\n\n\nThis activity would be suitable for an in-class example (of approximately 10 - 20 minutes) or can be modified to be a quiz or part of an exam.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComprehend the concept of one sample proportion hypothesis testing and its relevance in sports statistics.\nAnalyze and interpret dataset variables related to faceoff percentages in NCAA Division I Lacrosse.\nEvaluate a specific team’s faceoff performance by comparing it with league-wide statistics using hypothesis testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents are expected to have been exposed to the following concepts and use the activity to reinforce their understanding of these methods.\n\nBasic probability and percentages.\nNull and alternative hypotheses.\nSample size and sample proportion calculations.\nSuccess-failure condition for hypothesis testing.\nCalculation of test statistics (Z-score).\nUnderstanding significance levels (⍺) and p-values.\nDrawing conclusions and implications from hypothesis test results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData\nNote that because the activity only uses results from one team, students do not necessarily need to directly access this data. However, the activity can easily be adapted to use other teams. Instructors are encouraged to personalize the activity if they so choose.\nThe data set where the activities statistics come from contains 72 rows and 22 columns.

As we consider the broader implications of faceoffs in Division I Lacrosse, it becomes evident that faceoff wins play a pivotal role in team rankings and outcomes. The fact that Duke, the second-best team in the country, exhibited a faceoff win percentage above the league average highlights the significance of excelling in this aspect of the game. Winning faceoffs likely translates to higher goal-scoring opportunities, ultimately leading to more successful game outcomes.",

    "text": "Introduction\nIn NASCAR, driver rating is a metric used to evaluate the performance of drivers in races. It provides a comprehensive assessment of a driver’s overall competitiveness, efficiency, and consistency during a race. The driver rating is based on several key performance factors and is designed to offer a more objective view of a driver’s abilities. For this activity, you will be exploring the relationship between average position a driver finishes per lap over a season and their corresponding driver rating. Using data transformations techniques and polynomial regression to create different variations of linear models, you will enhance the capabilities of your models to make them more effective and accurate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about NASCAR\n\n\n\n\n\nNASCAR, the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, is a preeminent motorsports organization in the United States, distinguished by its high-speed competitions and fervent fanbase. Established in 1948 by Bill France Sr., NASCAR has evolved into a leading racing series that encompasses three national divisions: the NASCAR Cup Series, the Xfinity Series, and the Truck Series. The Cup Series is the most prestigious, showcasing the elite drivers and teams as they compete in events that span a variety of track types, typically oval in shape, and ranging from short tracks (0.24 miles) to expansive superspeedways (over 3 miles).\nThe races take place on diverse tracks across the nation, including renowned venues such as Daytona International Speedway and Talladega Superspeedway, where vehicles frequently exceed speeds of 200 miles per hour. NASCAR races serve as a complex interplay of driver skill, team strategy, and vehicle performance. Key metrics such as lap times, pit stop efficiency, and vehicle dynamics offer insights into the determinants of success in the sport. This not only enhances the understanding of race outcomes but also contributes to the development of strategies that optimize performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow NASCAR uses data\n\n\n\n\n\nThe video linked below is a panel discussion from the 2023 Sloan Sports Analytics Conference entitled Start Your Engines: How Data is Fueling NASCAR’s Strategy to Engage an Evolving Customer Base.\nAlthough the panel discussion is not directly related to this module, Justin Marks discusses how data is used in NASCAR during the 26:53 to 30:44 minute interval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity Length\n\n\n\n\n\nThis activity would be suitable for an in-class activity lasting approximately one class period or as an out-of-class assignment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of this activity, students will have reinforced the following skills:\n\nAssessing the effectiveness of simple linear regression models\nChecking regression model assumptions\nUsing log transformations to improve linear regression model fit\nApplying polynomial regression to model curved relationships\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this activity, students will need to use software to create scatterplots and plots of residual vs fitted values of models they will create. They will also need to create polynomial models and mutate the data by applying mathematic functions to columns.\nIt is assumed that students are already exposed to these concepts as the activity is intended to reinforce the skills instead of introduce them.\n\n\n\n\n\nData\nThe data comes from the NASCAR website and shows the season statistics from 2007-2022. Each row displays the metrics of a racer for that specific year. The data frame contains 1111 rows of observations and 20 variables.\nDownload data: nascar_driver_statistics.csv\n\n\nVariable Descriptions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nWins\nThe sum of the driver’s victories\n\n\nAvgStart\nThe sum of the driver’s starting positions divided by the number of races\n\n\nAvgMidRace\nThe sum of the driver’s mid race positions divided by the number of races\n\n\nAvgFinish\nThe sum of the driver’s finishing positions divided by the number of races\n\n\nAvgPos\nThe sum of the driver’s position each lap divided by the number of laps\n\n\nPassDiff\nThe sum of green flag passes minus green times passed\n\n\nGreenFlagPasses\nNumber of green flag passes performed by the driver\n\n\nGreenFlagPassed\nNumber of times driver is passed during green flag\n\n\nQualityPasses\nNumber of passes in the top 15 while under green flag conditions by driver\n\n\nPercentQualityPasses\nThe sum of quality passes divided by green flag passes\n\n\nNumFastestLaps\nNumber of where the driver had the fastest speed on the lap\n\n\nLapsInTop15\nNumber of laps completed while running in a top 15 position\n\n\nPercentLapsInTop15\nThe sum of the laps run in the top 15 divided by total laps completed\n\n\nLapsLed\nThe sum of the laps led in a race\n\n\nPercentLapsLed\nThe sum of the laps led in the race\n\n\nTotalLaps\nThe sum of the laps completed by a driver that year\n\n\nDriverRating\nFormula combining wins, finish, top15-finish, average running position while on lead lap, average speed under green, fastest lap, led most laps, and lead lap finish with a maximum rating of 150 points\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials\nClass handout\nClass handout - with solutions: MS Word\nClass handout - with solutions: Quarto\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, the Transforming NASCAR Driver Data worksheet offers valuable insights into the relationship between average position and driver rating in NASCAR. Through the transformation of the average position variable, the worksheet enables students to enhance linearity in their models, thereby improving the accuracy of their predictions and analysis. The identification of curvature in the variable relationship also allows for the model using quadratic regression to be highly effective. The model can be conceptually compared to the model using a square root transformation to capture the same curve. Assessing the effectiveness of each model, students can critically evaluate the different approaches and determine the most suitable model for the data. This exercise equips students with essential data transformation and modeling skills, empowering them to make informed decisions and gain a deeper understanding of the factors influencing a driver’s performance.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Welcome video\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nLeague of Legends (LoL) is a 5 v. 5 multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed by Riot Games. In this game, players assume the role of a “champion” with unique abilities and engage in intense battles against a team of other players or computer-controlled champions. Riot Games continually collects data to evaluate the impact of each champion, adjusting and fine-tuning various aspects to ensure fair and competitive gameplay. With regular updates (patches) occurring every two weeks, champions can become either extremely efficient and strong or in need of adjustments to enhance their abilities. Maintaining overall game balance is crucial, and developers employ strategies known as “nerfing” and “buffing” to achieve this balance. “Nerfing” refers to reducing the power or effectiveness of a champion or item, while “buffing” involves increasing its power or effectiveness.\nIn this worksheet, we will analyze and describe histograms of Win Rates for different champions in LoL. The Win Rate, a key metric in the game, represents the percentage of games won by a champion out of the total games played. Understanding the distribution of Win Rates and identifying potential outliers can provide valuable insights into champion balance and performance, informing strategic decision-making in LoL gameplay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of this activity, you will be able to:\n\nUnderstand the concept of histograms and their relevance in statistical analysis.\nAnalyze and describe histograms to gain insights into the distribution of Win Rates in League of Legends. In particular, being able to describe the center, shape, and spread of a distribution based on the displayed graph.\nIdentify potential outliers in a numerical variable using numerical methods such as the “1.5 IQR Rule” or z-scores.\nInterpret the implications of outliers in terms of champion balance and performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology requirement: The activity handout provides histograms and summary statistics so that no statistical software is required. However, the activity could be modified to ask students to produce that information from the raw dataset and/or extend the activity to investigate other variables available in the data.\n\nHistograms: Familiarity with histograms as a graphical representation of the distribution of a continuous variable, such as Win Rates, is crucial. You should understand how to interpret histograms, including the concepts of bins, frequencies, and the shape, center, and spread of distributions.\nOutliers: Knowledge of outliers, which are data points that deviate significantly from the overall pattern, is important.\nFamiliarity with basic statistical analysis techniques, such as measures of central tendency (mean, median) and measures of dispersion (standard deviation, range), will aid in interpreting and analyzing the histograms. These techniques can provide insights into the overall characteristics and variability of the Win Rates.\nKnowledge of outlier detection methods (such as the 1.5 IQR Rule and/or z-scores) is fundamental to the activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData\nA data frame for 162 champions of the following 7 variables. Each row represents a Champion that you can choose when playing League of Legends during patches 12.22 and 12.23. Note that the activity provided in this module does not use all of the variables provided. Instead they are provided for further analyses at the discretion of the user.\nAvailable on the SCORE Data Repository\nDownload data: LOL_patch_12.22.csv\nDownload data: LOL_patch_12.23.csv\n\n\nVariable Descriptions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nName\nname of the champion\n\n\nRole\nrole of the champion in a game\n\n\nKDA\nAverage kills, deaths and assists associated with each champion\n\n\nWRate\nwin rates of each champion\n\n\nPickRate\npick rates of each champion\n\n\nRolePerc\npercentage of time playing as a role\n\n\nBanPerc\nban percentages associated with each champion\n\n\n\n\n\nData Source\nLol champion stats, 12.22 master, win rates.

One notable finding from this worksheet is the identification of Sion as a low outlier in the Win Rates for the 12.22 patch. However, in the subsequent 12.23 patch, Sion’s Win Rate improved, and was no longer an outlier. Sion was given a Buff in patch 12.23, resulting in an enhanced performance and a more balanced Win Rate. However, patch 12.23 resulted in two new outliers with low win rates.\nThe continued presence of outliers highlights the importance of continuous monitoring and adjustments by game developers to ensure fair and competitive gameplay.",

However, instructors are still welcome to use these materials if they are so inclined.\n\n\nThis module examines the goals and shots in two prominent lacrosse leagues: the Premier Lacrosse League (PLL) and the National Lacrosse League (NLL). The PLL and NLL are highly regarded professional lacrosse leagues that feature top-tier athletes from around the world.\nThe PLL is played in an outdoor setting, following the field lacrosse format. This style of lacrosse is characterized by its larger field size, typically 110 yards by 60 yards. Field lacrosse involves 10 players per team and promotes a style of play that emphasizes long passes, intricate plays, and individual skills. Founded in 2019, the PLL operates with a touring model where teams travel to different cities each weekend, bringing the sport to a wide audience and fostering a festival-like atmosphere at each event. The league’s modernized approach includes a strong emphasis on media presence and player engagement. The PLL features approximately 200 athletes across its teams.\nIn contrast, the NLL follows the box lacrosse format, which is played indoors on a smaller, enclosed field, generally 200 feet by 85 feet. Box lacrosse involves 6 players per team, and the gameplay is marked by frequent physical interactions, quick ball movements, and high-intensity transitions. Established in 1986, the NLL has a traditional franchise model with teams based in specific cities across the United States and Canada. This structure has cultivated strong local fan bases and deep community ties, contributing to the league’s longevity. The NLL features approximately 500 athletes, many of which also play in the PLL.\nThese data, from the 2021-2022 seasons, allow for an analysis of goal-scoring within these leagues to identify differences between indoor (NLL) and outdoor (PLL) play.

    "title": "Ironman Triathlon (Canadian Females) - Multiple Linear Regression",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Welcome video\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nAn Ironman triathlon is one of the most grueling endurance events in the world, consisting of three sequential races: a 2.4-mile (3.86 km) swim, a 112-mile (180.25 km) bike ride, and a marathon 26.2-mile (42.20 km) run. The event tests the physical and mental limits of athletes, requiring months or even years of dedicated training. Originating in 1978 in Hawaii, the Ironman triathlon has become a global phenomenon, symbolizing the ultimate challenge in long-distance triathlon competitions.\nThe Triathlon Multiple Linear Regression module focuses on analyzing the relationships and predictive capabilities of multiple variables in the context of triathlon performance. Specifically, we will explore the prediction of run times (the last stage) using swim times and bike times as predictors. By employing simple regression models, checking conditions with residuals plots, and conducting hypothesis tests and confidence intervals, we aim to identify significant predictors and understand their contextual implications. The dataset used for this analysis comprises the 2022 Canadian finishers of the Lake Placid Ironman.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity Length\n\n\n\n\n\nThis activity would be suitable for an long in-class example (of approximately 30 - 60 minutes) or out-of-class assignment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstand the concept of multiple linear regression and its application in analyzing sports data.\nRecognize the importance of checking assumptions, such as assessing residuals vs. fits plots, for validating the regression models.\nGain insights into the significance of predictors through hypothesis tests and confidence intervals.\nComprehend the interpretation and contextual implications of the findings from multiple linear regression analyses in the triathlon setting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n\n\n\n\n\nTo successfully complete this worksheet, students should have prior knowledge of the following statistical concepts:\n\nFamiliarity with simple linear regression, including interpretation of slopes, intercepts, and residuals.\nUnderstanding of hypothesis testing and confidence intervals, particularly in the context of regression analysis.\nKnowledge of residual analysis, including the interpretation of residual plots.\nBasic understanding of the triathlon sport and its components (swimming, biking, and running) to better grasp the contextual implications of the statistical analyses.\n\nTechnology requirement:\n\nThe “no tech” version of the activity uses Minitab to display the output and requires only simple hand calculations (for predictions and residuals).\nThe provided “tech required” handout assumes that students can use technology (such as Minitab) to perform a multiple linear regression analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData\nThe data set has 64 rows with 17 columns. Each row represents a Canadian female who has participated in the 2022 Lake Placid Ironman. Note that this data set includes more variables than what are needed to complete the activity. Students are welcome to further explore the data using these additional variables.\nDownload data: ironman_lake_placid_female_2022_canadian.csv\n\n\nVariable Descriptions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nBib\nregistration number of each runner used for identification\n\n\nName\nThe participant’s name\n\n\nCountry\nWhat country the participant is from\n\n\nGender\nThe participant’s gender\n\n\nDivision\nThe age range or membership a runner is\n\n\nDivision.Rank\nWithin the divisions, the place each runner has obtained over all races\n\n\nOverall.Time\nThe total time it took to complete the Ironman in minutes\n\n\nOverall.Rank\nThe runner’s finishing place for that particular triathlon\n\n\nSwim.Time\nThe time in minutes it took to complete the swimming portion\n\n\nSwim.Rank\nThe place the runner finished for the swim portion\n\n\nBike.Time\nThe time in minutes it took to complete the biking portion\n\n\nBike.Rank\nThe place the runner finished for the bike portion\n\n\nRun.Time\nThe time in minutes it took to complete the running portion\n\n\nRun.Rank\nThe place the runner finished for the running portion\n\n\nFinish.Status\nStates whether someone completed the Ironman successfully\n\n\nLocation\nWhere the Ironman takes place\n\n\nYear\nThey year when the mentioned participant ran\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials\nClass handout - requires technology\nClass handout - no technology required\nClass handout - with solutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, the Triathlon Multiple Linear Regression worksheet has provided valuable insights into the predictors of run times in the Lake Placid 2022 Ironman Canadian Finishers dataset. Initially, both Swim Time and Bike Time demonstrated significance as individual predictors, supported by hypothesis tests and confidence intervals. The hypothesis test for the slope term of Bike Time yielded a p-value of 0, indicating its significance. Additionally, the 95% confidence interval for the slope term of Swim Time excluded 0, further affirming its significance.\nHowever, when both Swim Times and Bike Times were included as predictors in the multiple linear regression model, we observed a change in significance. Swim Times were no longer a significant predictor. This finding suggests that when considering both predictors simultaneously, the predictive power of Swim Times in estimating run times diminishes. These findings emphasize the importance of evaluating multiple predictors in regression analysis and understanding how their inclusion can impact the significance and interpretation of individual predictors.",
